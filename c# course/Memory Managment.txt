In Parameters
	double Measure(in Point p)
		1)passed by reference
		2)in makes the structure read-only
Ref readonly variables
	private static Point origin = new Point();
	public static ref readonly Point Origin => ref orogin;
	
	ref readonly var originRef = ref Point.Origin;
	

	Types of memory:
		Managed memory(new operator)
			small objects < 85K (generations)
			Large object > 85K (Large Object Heap, LOH)
			Both released by GC
		Unmanaged Memory
			Allocated on unmanaged heap
				Marshal.AllocHGlobal
				Marshal.AllocCoTaskMem
			Released with 
				Marshal.FreeHGlobal
				Marshal.FreeCoTaskMem
		Stack memory (stackalloc)
			very fast allocation/deallocation
			very small <1MB , overallocate => process dies (stack overflow)
			Method-scoped - stack unwind
			
Ref struct
	a value type that must be stack-allocated.
	can never be member of another class.
	support to Span<T>
	compiler-enforce rules
		can't box a ref struct
		can't declare a ref struct as a member of class
		can't declare in async methods
		can't declare in iterator
		can't declare in lambda
	rules prevent a ref struct to be promoted to the managed heap
