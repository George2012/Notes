Core Concepts:

1)Computer Csience

2)Artificial Intelligence

3)Big Data
	VVV Velocity Volume Variety
	Apache Spark
	Apache Hadoop

4)Machine Learning
	Example Inputs/Outputs (Data)
	Generate a Model (Training the Model)
	New Inputs (Get a predicition)
	Evaluate the Model (How's ot working)
	Supervised Learning   - (labeled) 	Value you want to predict is in the Data
	Unsupervised Learning - (unlabeled) Value you want to predict isn't in the Data
	reinforcement learning
	ML Takes Data looks for patterns and creates a model
	Consept of 
		Sensetivity - TPR (True positive rate)
		Specificity - TNR (True negative rate)
	Consider your evaluation of "least costly mistake"
	
5)Data science -
	is the process of obtaining, transforming analysing and 
	communicating data to answer a question.
