Examples Input (Data)
Generate a Model (Train a Model)
New input (feed inputs that model have never seen before) Get Predicition
Evaluate (Tune)

Data:

5 steps:
1) Asking Question
2) Obtain Data
3) apply ML algorithm
4) Evaluate Model
	use criteria from step 1
	test with holdback data / cross validation
5) Use Model
	Adjsut data (from different sources)
	Adjust algorithm
	Tune algorithm to not overfit (or underfit) the data
	



Algorithm examples:
1) Decision Trees
	Classificaion Trees
	Regression Trees
2) Naive Bayesian Classifier 
3) Neural Networks
4) kNN
