1)The problem 
	what question are we asking
	what resources we have
		people
		data sources
			structed
			unstructed
	what rules are relevant
	what is "done" look
	how will we measure the performance
	what kind of errors will we tolarate
		false negatives
		false positives
		Sensitivity/ Specificity
2)The data
	Quality
	Cost
	Speed
	
  In-house dats
  Third Party Data
	Data Broker
		Google, Facebook Twitter.

	Redit Comments
	Wikipedia
  Creating Data
	Scraping Data
  Preparing Data:
	Missing Data
	Inconsistant Data
	Duplicate Data
  Tidy(accuarate) Data
	1) Each varaible(feature) is in its own column
	2) Each observation(cases) is in its own row
	3) Each value is in its own cell
  Data is often as WIDE (variables) as it is LONG (observations)
3)Machine Learning Algorithm
	Performance
	right data
	right question
	
	4 algorithms:
		1)Decision Trees
			a)Classification Trees(finite values)
			b)Regression Trees (continuous values)
		2)Naive Bayesian Classifier
			example: SPAM classifier
		3)Neural Networks
			network of "neurons" (graph)
				- neurons directly connected to the input/output
				- neurons connected to each other (hidden)
				- all connections have a "weight"
				Training a network means getting the value of these weight
				A set of weights as a model.
				Good for unstructed data
				and where rule based learning can't work.
				examples: hand writing recognition
						  speech recognition.
						  face recognition.
		4)kNN (K's nearest neighbor)
			Great for classification
			use "neigbourhoods" of data based on variables, predictors or features
			k - is number of how many neigbours to consider
4)Evaluating the performance of the Model and adjusting
	Evaluate performance
		- Use creteria established in step #1
		- Test with hold back data / cross validation
	Adjust Performance
		- pull different data
	Adjust the algorithm
		- Generalization/Regularization
			playing it too simple
		- Over fit
			where the model in test data that not exist in  real data
			too complex
		- more selective about variables
		- can shrink each varaible holds
	Adjusting or tune the question
5)Using and presenting the model
 grab other data and use it as a test
