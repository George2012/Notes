training data

scikit-learn
	sklearn
		Define: What type of model will it be? A decision tree? Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.
		Fit: Capture patterns from provided data. This is the heart of modeling.
		Predict: Just what it sounds like
		Evaluate: Determine how accurate the model's predictions are.


evaluate 
	Mean Absolute Error (also called MAE).
	error=abs(actualâˆ’predicted)
		On average, our predictions are off by about X.

Underfitting and overfitting
	improve you model

Overfitting: capturing spurious patterns that won't recur in the future, leading to less accurate predictions, or
Underfitting: failing to capture relevant patterns, again leading to less accurate predictions.

We use validation data, which isn't used in model training, to measure a candidate model's accuracy. This lets us try many candidate models and keep the best one.
