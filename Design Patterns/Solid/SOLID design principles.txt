SOLID design principles:
1)Single Responsibility principle
2)Open-Close principle
	open for extension, closed for modification
3)Liskov Substitution principle
	Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes
	w/o altering the correctness of the program
4)Interface segregation principle
5)Dependency inversion principle
	 A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
	    Both should depend on abstractions.
	 B. Abstractions should not depend on details. 
	    Details should depend on abstractions.
